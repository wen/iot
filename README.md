## Introduction
This project aims to deepen our knowledge by making us use [K3d](https://k3d.io) and [K3s](https://k3s.io) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

We will learn how to set up a personal virtual machine with Vagrant and CentOS. 

Then, we will learn how to use K3s and its [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/). 

Last but not least, we will discover K3d that will simplify our life.

These steps will get us started with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

> This project is a minimal introduction to Kubernetes.</br>
> Indeed, this tool is too complex to be mastered in a single subject.

## General guidelines
1. The whole project has to be done in a virtual machine.
2. We have to put all the configuration files of our project in folders located at the root of the repository (go to Submission and peer-evaluation for more information). The folders of the mandatory part will be named: **p1**, **p2** and **p3**. And the bonus one: **bonus**.
3. This topic requires us to apply concepts that, depending on our background, we may not have covered yet. Therefore we will not be afraid to read a lot of documentation to learn how to use **K8s** with **K3s**, as well as **K3d**.

> We can use any tools we want to set up our host virtual machine as well as the provider used in Vagrant.

## Mandatory part

This project will consist of setting up several environments under specific rules.

It is divided into three parts we have to do in the following order:
- **[`Part 1`](https://github.com/wen/iot/wiki/Part-1:-K3s-and-Vagrant)**: K3s and Vagrant
- **[`Part 2`](https://github.com/wen/iot/wiki/Part-2:-K3s-and-three-simple-applications)**: K3s and three simple applications
- **[`Part 3`](https://github.com/wen/iot/wiki/Part-3:-K3d-and-Argo-CD)**: K3d and Argo CD

## Bonus part
The following extra is intended to be useful: [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) needs to be added in the lab we did in [Part 3](https://github.com/wen/iot/tree/master/p3).

‚ò†Ô∏è **[This bonus](https://github.com/wen/iot/tree/master/bonus) is complex**. The latest version available of Gitlab from the official website is expected.

We are allowed to use whatever we need to achieve this extra. For example, [helm](https://helm.sh) could be useful here.
- Our Gitlab instance must run locally
- Gitlab must be configured to make it work with our cluster
- A dedicated namespace named `gitlab` needs to be created
- Everything we did in [Part 3](https://github.com/wen/iot/tree/master/p3) must work with our local Gitlab

We can add everything needed so our entire cluster works.
